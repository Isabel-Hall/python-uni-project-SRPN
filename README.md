# python-uni-project-SRPN
First python uni project, discovering and replicating the functions of an example reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator

We were provided an example RPN calculator on repl.it to interact with. We were not able to see any of the coding that went into this calculator and had to discover its functions through experitmentation. The calculator had been designed to perform mathematical operations but also to have "quirks" and less expected outputs. Working individually, we were then tasked with exactly replicating firstly the basic mathematical functions and then the more obscure operations.
